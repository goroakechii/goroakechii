ㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤbritish (england located). I am autistic, I have tics/tourette's, bpd and possibly adhd as well.
ㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤI have terrible social anxiety, but I love making friends. as long as you're not 19+ (I'm almost 16), I'd love to be friends!

my main interests are the persona games (persona 5, 3 & 4), kcd, assassin's creed and a few more - but mainly those.

I find it difficult to befriend people who have little to no of the same interests as me, I'm also awkward at first unless we click.

I can't talk to overly dry people, those who oftenly use too many tonetags (/j, etc are fine), or anything genuinely negative. I like a lot of alone time, but I can also be affectionate (depending). I have terrible jealousy, attatchment and abandonment issues.

If that may bother you, I suggest you don't interact with me. reassurance means a lot to me, however I am quite independent, so I don't really ask for it. I often go quiet and distant if upset, so don't think you've done anything wrong. I prefer to discuss problems between us rather than argue, by the way.
